Wow, 10 years since I write down a serious entry on a blog.

Now, I'm starting a new project where I will keep update with some code, some
diagrams, a LOT of networking and security stuff (vendors, basics, tutorials, 
how-to, youtube, etc) and also an experiences from a new guy on IT Consulting.

The last time I was blogging, I was in college accomplishing a Bachelor's 
degree, that I achieve, so many of my entrys at that time was about the college
 life.

Now, with Github Pages I felt it's even more easy from offline -> online setup 
a post. 

So, let's this GP start.
